I am a PHD student at the Graphics and Imaging Lab, working under the supervision of Prof. Belén Masiá and Prof. Ana Serrano. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and my Master's degree in Robotics, Graphics and Computer Vision at Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain). I started my PHD in 2024, and my thesis focuses on the study of multimodality in Virtual Reality through the use of physiological and behavioral signals.
